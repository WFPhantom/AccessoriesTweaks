# Accessories Tweaks | [![][cf-shield]][cf-link] [![][mr-shield]][mr-link]
This is a small client-side mod that tweaks the Experimental menu in Accessories to be made more survival friendly. This is mostly made for my modpack, where the Experimental menu replaces the vanilla inventory and is bound to E.




#### This mod:
- Makes it so the Accessories menu bind closes inventories (To replicate vanilla 'E' behaviour)
- Makes the crafting grid always appear and removes the crafting grid toggle button


#### More integrations and features planned, such as:
- Multiloader
- Fix being able to hold items in the vanilla crafting grid
- Make Apothic Attibutes button appear in the menu (Neo only)
